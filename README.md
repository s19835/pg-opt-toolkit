# PostgreSQL Query Optimizer Toolkit

## Project Overview
The PostgreSQL Query Optimizer Toolkit is a powerful CLI tool designed to help database administrators and developers analyze, optimize, and visualize PostgreSQL query execution plans. By leveraging PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, the tool provides actionable insights to improve query performance through indexing recommendations, execution plan visualization, and configuration management.

## Features
- **Query Analysis**: Parses execution plans and identifies performance bottlenecks.
- **Index Recommender**: Suggests optimal indexes based on query patterns.
- **Visualization**: Converts execution plans into easy-to-understand visual representations.
- **Configuration Management**: Handles user preferences and historical analysis results.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
